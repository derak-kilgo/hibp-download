# HIBP Pwned Passwords Downloader (PHP)

This script downloads the complete set of [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) password hash **range files** using the 
[k-Anonymity model](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) and saves them locally for offline querying or bulk analysis.

## Features

- No external dependencies except for php and ext-curl
- Fully automated download of all `16^5` (1,048,576) hash prefixes.
- Parallel downloads in batches
- Intelligent retry handling
- Resumable: skips already-downloaded ranges.
- Includes tools to compile the result to a binary file which is 48% smaller and cli or server tools to search the binary index.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.1 or later with cURL extension enabled or docker installed.
* 80GB of disk space. (Uncompressed download is ~49GB. Processed binary lookup file is ~27GB.)

## Usage

### Download Index.

Either `php tools/download.php`

or 

`bash tools/download.sh`

* Both tools work. The bash version is a little faster but the php version is the fastest resume.

* Expect weird things to happen. You're triggering a download of 1M+ files 100 at a time. It takes a bit.
    This tool can exhaust a cheap routers file handles, cause network glitches or generally reveal problems with your network setup.

* Expect this to take an hour even with a fast connection.

* The final product will be > 58GB

### Convert your text index to a binary one.

`php combine-to_bin.php`

* Reading and combining 1M+ files takes time. Right now its around 4o minutes.
* Once you have your binary in place, you can try out the search or server options.

### Search the database.

`php ./tools/search-bin.php 000A7036BC418BFF2F7FEF93C36BC7A748B55DBE`

### Start the dev server

`php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t ./public`

The open a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080?hash=000A7036BC418BFF2F7FEF93C36BC7A748B55DBE


## Notes

* This script respects HIBP's usage policy â€” includes a custom User-Agent header.
* Be considerate with API usage: the full download can be bandwidth and disk intensive (~50GB uncompressed).
* You may optionally add a short delay between batches (e.g., sleep(1)) to reduce server load.
* Enable logging in config.php only if needed. It will slow down all operations. (download,search and server)
* Since the data is sorted, our search functions use a binary search to look for your hash instead of scanning the whole list.
